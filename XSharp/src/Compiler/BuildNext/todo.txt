- Extract the Codegenerator from the CodeDomprovider in a separate DLL
- Link the CodeDomprovider to this component
- Create a WriteCodeFragment Task
<UsingTask TaskName="WriteCodeFragment" AssemblyFile="$(FSharpBuildAssemblyFile)" />
- Create this task from the example in the FSharp.Build.DLL and link the code generation to the new DLL

- Test the build process with the BeforeCommonProps
- Check 'old' style csproj to see what is imported
- Make sure our projects import similar things
- Check how the publishing of C# works and what's needed to do that for X#
- Check how the build as single exe works
- Check how Roslyn Nuget interacts with MsBuild and see if we can do it in a similar way with our nuget package
- Same for creating Nuget packages
